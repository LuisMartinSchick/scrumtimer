# Scrumtimer
Simple timer for daily standups, which allows each person a maximum of two minutes to speak. 
Timer is set to be always on top, so it can be displayed over Jira/ticketing software with no issue. 
This was quickly thrown together in Intellij, making use of the Intellij form designer - you will probably need to use Intellij to build this.
